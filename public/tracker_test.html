	<h2>Installing the tracker code in your own page</h2>
	<p>Installation is very similar to Google Analytics.  Add the following to the bottom of your page just before
		the end of the body tag</p><br />
	<pre>
		&lt;script src="http://www.noexpectations.com.au/javascripts/tracker.js" type='text/javascript' >&lt;/script>
		&lt;script>
		  tracker = new _tks(); 
		  tracker.trackPageview();
		&lt;/script>
	</pre>
	<br />
	<h2>Changes:</h2>
	<ul><li>Now supports an account code: <pre>tracker = new _tks('account code')</pre> but since the domains aren't
		set up then yet, it won't send anything properly if you use it.</li>
		<li>Now will do http or https depending on the protocol of the loaded page.  This will avoid any "unsecure bits from
			secure page" messages.</li>
		<li>Added parameter 'utmcs' to describe character encoding of the document, taken from any provided meta
			http-equiv tag.
		</li>		
	</ul>		
	<br />
	<h2>Important notes:</h2>
	<ul><li>Of course we need a hosting site for the tracking stuff.  It's currently on my site but thats just for testing.</li>
		<li>No account tagging yet which is why that call is currently commented out. We'll use the accoun
		tag to indentify on whose behalf the campaign is run.  It will be the same name as the account name in the
		application, so will be easy to automatically generate the template code</li>
		<li>Needs lots of testing in different browsers and versions.  It *should* work pretty much everywhere.</li>
		<li>Does not include outbound link tagging although thats a possibility for later.  It's harder to make work
			in all browsers since it requires DOM hacking.</li>
		<li>Campaigns are tracked the same way as Google.  Add the utm_name, utm_source, utm_medium and utm_content
			parameters to the inbound link to the tracked page.  These are the same names that Google gives so that
			people who know how to build campaign pages for Google Analytics can do the same for us (and links could be 
			reused if desired).  Google lets you change the name of these parameters and we can do that too in the next version
			of this code (it's very easy).</li>
		<li>Note that the URL we send to the tracker does not include the userAgent or Referer strings since they are sent in the
			header of the http request and therefore are in the logfile anyway.  Same for the IP address of the user</li>
		<li>We could technically send the Google Analytics tracking cookie __utma as well.  That would help correlate our data with GA
			data.  As long as it is anonymously used and we declare a cookie policy I think that's within the terms of service. It's 
			not currently sent.</li>
		<li>GA sends the character encoding of the page.  Not sure we need to do that - and we currently don't</li>	
	</ul>	
	<br />
	<h2>Testing</h2>
	<p>The key things to test are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>That the session id changes when either (a) there is no visit to the page for at least 30 minutes OR (b) you close the browser
			and then reopen it and return to the site.  In FF3 at the moment I am not seeing the (b) part working as I would expect.  More testing 
			required.</li>
		<li>That the visitor id stays the same for each visit (in each browser, since it's stored in a cookie).  I've tested the uniqueness by running
			the algorithm up to 1,000,000 times and there were no duplicates.  Not guarantee of course, but pretty solid I think.  As far as I can tell
			the Google algorithm returns about 200 dups for a 1,000,000 iteration test.  But I might not have analysed that fully.</li>
		<li>That the campaign parameters are sent correctly - this is how we link up the user and the campaign.</li>
		<li>Check for javascript errors in the console or wherever errors are detected!</li>
		<li>Check the flash version is correct (and is that enough info for what we need?)</li>
	</ul>
