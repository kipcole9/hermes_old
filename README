== Welcome to Hermes

Hermes is an effort to build yet another publishing and asset management system.  It grew
out of the desire to have a way to better publish my photographs - and what better way than to
build ones own system to achieve that.

== Note

This is definitely not ready for use.  Although I expect to be in production on my
own site soon, it is not really useable by anyone else. Don't even try.
