== Welcome to Hermes

Hermes is an effort to build yet another publishing and asset management system.  It grew
out of the desire to have a way to better publish my photographs - and what better way than to
build ones own system to achieve that.

== Note

This is definitely not ready for use.  Although I expect to be in production on my
own site soon, it is not really useable by anyone else. Don't even try.

==TODO

1.  Images "near here" with distance and direction.  Ajax load below the image.
2.  Paging of Articles
3.  Templating of Category pages (ie. if ?category=zzzz  then use article_zzz template name if it exists.)
4.  Edit image page
5.  Image upload allow parameters (for cases where the image has not metadata - like from a camera phone.  Especially 'title')
6.  Admin provide larger map for geolocating.  Ajax load below the image (before comments).
7.  Image Gallery to allow dynamic definition
8.  Refactor map javascript.
